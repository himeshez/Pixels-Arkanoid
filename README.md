# Pixels Arkanoid

It's a clone of the classic arcade game created with the experimental Unity DOTS technologies. The game is based on the original Arkanoid gameplay. And the visual style refers to the games of the 16-bit era.

The goal of this project is to get to know Unity DOTS better. The DOTS (Data-Oriented Technology Stack) is a set of technologies developed by Unity for building high-performance, multithreaded code. The most important part of DOTS is the ECS component system, which allows to write code in a data oriented way. The DOTS Arkanoid project uses physics and rendering built on ECS (DOTS Physics and Hybrid Renderer). Some technical details are described below.

## Game design details

* Original game mechanics and retro look inspired by [Arkanoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkanoid) arcade game and SNES Arkanoid: Doh It Again 1997 by Taito. Local coop mode inspired by Block Block (World 910910) arcade game by Capcom.
* For input you can use touch screen, keyboard (A, D, Left, Right, Space), a mouse (only player 1) and gamepads (Xbox Controller/XInput)
* Catch, Enlarge, Laser, Disruption and other power-ups have implemented, hi score and balls speedup mechanics have implemented as well.
* 5 original stages are included, arcade version of field size 13x18 is used.
* The ball movement and bouncing physics is close to the original Arkanoid physics.
* Press Alt+Enter to switch between full screen and windowed mode (for desktop builds).

## Tech details

* Pure ECS in runtime, except Audio, UI and resources, where [managed components](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@1.0/manual/components-managed.html) are used.
* URP + [Entities Graphics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities.graphics@1.0/manual/index.html) with shader for UV coord. animation.
* [DOTS Physics](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.physics@latest/index.html) for triggers (ICollisionEventsJob), queries (CastCollider) and masks filtering
* Burst compilation and jobs scheduling is used for most jobs, however, some sync points optimizations are possible.
* You can use "F1" cheat button to spawn multiple balls.
